				<p class="poem-content">
					I lay next to my girl, <br/>
					distraught, heavy <br/>
					on her bed that she made, <br/>
					and the headboard<br/>
					that her and her dad <br/>
					actually made, <br/>
					my sinuses <br/>
					set to burst <br/>
					like a frozen pipe <br/>
					in winter, I said <br/>
					something like, <br/>
					&ldquo;everything sucks.&rdquo; <br/>
					Her size 5&rsquo;s were tucked<br/> 
					under her butt <br/>
					with the side of my leg <br/>
					stretched out      before her, <br/>
					she put her fingers on my leg<br/>
					like a piano. I don&rsquo;t mean it <br/>
					as a metaphor, it was actually <br/>
					like a piano, she intended it<br/>
					that way, she sang loud, <br/>
					even though it was <br/>
					only a whisper, but loud. <br/>
					She sang, &ldquo;Everythinnng <br/>
					Suuucks!&rdquo; Then put <br/>
					her fingers again <br/>
					on my leg <br/>
					like a piano, exactly <br/>
					like a piano,<br/>
					throwing her head <br/>
					and torso around<br/>
					like she was a genius,<br/>
					Beethoven or someone,<br/>
					pouring it all into <br/>
					my leg. I don&rsquo;t <br/>
					mean it to be dramatic,<br/>
					it was funny, so funny <br/>
					we couldn&rsquo;t breathe, <br/>
					she continued, her <br/>
					and me in an apartment <br/>
					the size     <br/>
					of a small room <br/>
					in a big house. <br/>
					We weren&rsquo;t a secret<br/>
					even though it was<br/>
					just us, but I&rsquo;m saying<br/>
					everything sucked, <br/>
					then nothing did, <br/>
					and maybe you had<br/>
					to be there, <br/>
					but I wasâ€”there. <br/>
					She played me <br/>
					with my own<br/>
					words. Let the record<br/>
					show: It sounded <br/>
					good, it sounded <br/>
					good&ndash;on this planet <br/>
					where we live,<br/>
					it sounded clear <br/>
					as a song I love, <br/>
					one I would give anything<br/>
					to have been there <br/>
					the first time it uncorked <br/>
					from a powerful woman, <br/>
					when it met the world<br/>
					the first time, <br/>
					that&rsquo;s how it sounded. <br/>
					Like I would give anything <br/>
					to be there <br/>
