				<p class="poem-content">
					Two guitars were left in a room all alone<br/>
					They sat on different corners of the parlor<br/>
					In this solitude they started talking to each other<br/>
					My strings are tight and full of tears<br/>
					The man who plays me has no heart<br/>
					I have seen it leave out of his mouth<br/>
					I have seen it melt out of his eyes<br/>
					It dives into the pores of the earth<br/>
					When they squeeze me tight I bring<br/>
					Down the angels who live off the chorus<br/>
					The trios singing loosen organs<br/>
					With melodious screwdrivers<br/>
					Sentiment comes off the hinges<br/>
					Because a song is a mountain put into<br/>
					Words and landscape is the feeling that<br/>
					Enters something so big in the harmony<br/>
					We are always in danger of blowing up<br/>
					With passion<br/>
					The other guitar:<br/>
					In 1944 New York<br/>
					When the Trio Los Panchos started<br/>
					With Mexican & Puerto Rican birds<br/>
					I am the one that one of them held<br/>
					Tight &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a woman<br/>
					Their throats gardenia gardens<br/>
					An airport for dreams<br/>
					I've been in theaters and cabarets<br/>
					I played in an apartment on 102nd street<br/>
					After a baptism pregnant with women<br/>
					The men flirted and were offered<br/>
					Chicken soup<br/>
					Echoes came out of hallways as if from caves<br/>
					Someone is opening the door now<br/>
					The two guitars hushed and there was a<br/>
					Resonance in the air like what is left by<br/>
					The last chord of a bolero.<br/>
