				<p class="poem-content">
					a dove in a tux for sure<br/>
					and did they carry trays with salmon sandwiches<br/>
					and thimbles of twinings and cucumber bits<br/>
					like good little waiters<br/>
					aren&rsquo;t they smart like fluent in six languages<br/>
					or am I thinking of blue whales  yes I know it<br/>
					greats are both lovely and moltenly<br/>
					irritating when they eat for example chicken<br/>
					my great uncle opens to entire wings<br/>
					older lower flying times<br/>
					asks after the washski after the barnski asks<br/> 
					after<br/>
					eye-talian dressin asks who it was what last saw<br/>
					that neighbor of ours<br/>
					the big dumb fat swede and<br/>
					the hay ride cost a nickel do you think<br/>
					we had a nickel? no we shore didn&rsquo;t<br/>
					though he can lord one tough over us<br/>
					none have known<br/>
					flour sack underwear<br/> 
					to nettle the privates<br/>
					as we saunter through barcelona<br/>
					lonesome and detached from the war<br/>
					ploosh ploosh went his niece&rsquo;s arms into washing suds<br/><br/>
					in other folks&rsquo; houses that&rsquo;s how they made ends meet after<br/>
					max got run over by a hay wagon and lived<br/>
					yes it&rsquo;s a shark vertebra I was dreaming it was<br/> 
					me slow dancing with a macaroon breath manatee<br/>
					was the manatee put that ice shaving in my ear<br/> 
					shark  swish of our boots<br/>
					shark  peck on the cheek  swish of our boots<br/>  
					shark and lying on my kitchen table  yes I see the seismic denture shine<br/> 
					it's a day glow green cowboy shirt constellated with rhinestones<br/>
					like greg brown says people say small things<br/>
					when they stay too long in little rooms<br/> 
					o I am at least a gooseful of hours outdoors everyday<br/>
					the sun these days is geeked in bees  dandified  curative  elixir<br/>  
					say now  what is it the curate uses on his bleeding gums?<br/>  
					answer  bee&rsquo;s knees<br/>
					bowling ball talc and the penguin joke<br/>
					concerning the penguin and hyena<br/>
					down at the rodeo  it goes without saying<br/>
					my grandpa&rsquo;s head is one helluva circus<br/>
					never was a religious man<br/>
					people say he walked with deer<br/>
					tickled their chins<br/>
					flipped kernels of field corn<br/>
					off his thumb<br/>
					in and down their dog nun hatches<br/>
					alzheimer&rsquo;s now  sad because<br/>
					never would have wished to live this far from deer<br/>
					happy when he doesn&rsquo;t pine<br/>
					happy when his bed is<br/> 
					cut from skin of moon<br/> 
					how much you need?<br/> 
					and bart and brett and starr and favre<br/> 
					a five a hundred<br/>
					million million<br/>
					my ball playing shoulder pads sleeping<br/>
					thousand dollar bills<br/>
					I sign a dream in ball playing turf<br/>
					and pretty gals with dentist drills<br/>
					dig up my scores<br/>
					patch them in their watered patch and never<br/>
					run short again<br/> 
					listen to my grandpa<br/>
					thin as howled down birches<br/> 
					sawing off another<br/>
					stretch pants aphorism<br/>
					other day he says and he<br/>
					paints his eyes up and down to where he is silken and invisible<br/>
					could walk through walls into the blue pens if he wanted to<br/>
					into the 69 ounce shit bag of cola if he wanted to<br/>
					lifted to the painted mouth of the lady in the office who&rsquo;s just now<br/>
					licking an envelope full of tenants&rsquo; checks<br/>
					costs 3000 a month to stay in this assisted hoohaa<br/> 
					would have wanted us to<br/>
					put a little t-shirt on him and send him out in<br/>
					zero wind chill  saying go  go on gramps<br/>
					go on out and find the pin sheared off the tractor last june<br/>
					paints his eyes up and down<br/> 
					last night jesus come by<br/>
					you know jesus is back and he&rsquo;s all around<br/>
					I see him sort of sashay in and sing<br/>
					jesus bill they&rsquo;re making electric cars on the cold side of the moon<br/>
					no joke and a raving coffee gnashing<br/>
					flashlight coffee kind of guy jesus has his<br/>
					leg up on my bed and he&rsquo;s keeping time on<br/>
					my sternum and he&rsquo;s frailing on this little<br/>
					guitar you would have thought was half dead<br/>
					he says this guitar was once an orphan what got the mange<br/>
					he says<br/>
					you got good belly muscles seems you laughed<br/>
					a lot in your prime mind and I says<br/>
					cut it with the eye-talian dressing drizzled on<br/>
					iceberg lettuce speeches bub<br/>
					and I says the most pained thing ever happened was<br/>
					brother clyde in that mummy ice down by the river<br/> 
					and no I never hardly laughed I was yelling<br/>
					goddamn it this fucking christmas tree<br/> 
					my ma died giving birth to me why I<br/>
					swing a heavy axe in the month of february<br/>
					see then jesus sorta put his slipper up off my belly<br/>
					and onto the side of the bed to where I could<br/>
					contrive my arm under the bed and<br/>
					jesus says I will just do a little elvis number for you and I says<br/>
					fine that&rsquo;ll be fine I might just call in some of my<br/>
					good old great big dumb swede friends if you don&rsquo;t mind<br/>
					o bless his fig herring heart<br/>
					jesus closes his eyes to say he don&rsquo;t mind plus to<br/>
					try and  you know  calling collect connect<br/>
					and that&rsquo;s when I snake skin my arm under the bed<br/>
					and come out with this great big lug of an old tire iron<br/>
					and rare it up<br/>
					and just when he lays into how I ain&rsquo;t nothing but an old hound dog<br/>
					wham  see I clock jesus right over his fool head<br/>
					and awoosh see  he separates into a million a million<br/>
					breaks down fast to moths butterflies<br/>
					sparks sparring gloves stars footballs<br/>
					which I catch one of the footballs<br/>
					and make a dash for the end zone<br/>
					where this band is playing<br/>
					I can&rsquo;t say for fact the toot<br/>
					but I do say galoots smooching tubas<br/>
					and clyde swinging a fountain drink<br/>
					drumstick down on frozen birds<br/>
					and how I sorta slipped off<br/>
					into the silver innards<br/> 
					of that music playing machine<br/>
