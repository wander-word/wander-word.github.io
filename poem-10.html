					Summer<br/>
					what will she bring you?<br/>
					a small brass cup of cherry wine<br/>
					cocoanut shavings in the palm of your hand<br/>
					rain sugaring the ochre<br/>
					blue green vines twisting in braids<br/>
					and long maroon bars of sun&rsquo;s eye shutting<br/>
					a beach racing stripe<br/>
					<br/>
					what will Summer bring?<br/>
					mushrooms &ndash; their blistering occurrence<br/>
					<br/>
					a forest of days<br/>
					can we make a forest of your summers?<br/>
					can we chop and burn one and listen to it whistle and pop all night?<br/>
					<br/>
					what migration of nostalgia<br/>
					what thawed river you&rsquo;ve been afraid to cup your hands and suck from<br/>
					what brash recline on unknown beds, sleeping bags, mats, floors, moss<br/>
					what bruising last words that rush out naked carrying too much<br/>
					what platter of peaches and grapes ripe with bronze shadows<br/>
					<br/>
					this Summer will ruin your sentences<br/>
					when the boy you love sings your name<br/>
					when all you can say is &ldquo;O&rdquo;<br/>
					when his voice blushes your whole body<br/>
					his breath shaky down your neck<br/>
					<br/>
					Summer, don&rsquo;t spare me this year<br/>
					bring me high, bring me star shaved sky<br/>
					bring me this year&rsquo;s wild grass &ndash; timothy, foxtail, blackbent, and redtop<br/>
					bring me green fisted buds, green clapping leaves and cursive pea shoots<br/>
					<br/>
					Summer, I&rsquo;m here for you, unwaltzed and ready<br/>
					bring back those mushrooms from two stanzas ago<br/>
					bring me fern, flags of the understory<br/>
					bring me the hierarchy of mountains<br/>
					their sapphire lakes and river tresses<br/>
					their cool wolf toothed caves fur lined into gold veined tunnels<br/>
					<br/>
					let&rsquo;s go back to the lakes &ndash; let&rsquo;s not skip their depth<br/>
					their barking blue plunges<br/>
					wet worms and snails curled on shorelines<br/>
					clams flutter, those mud-ears slipping open<br/>
					to swallow water&rsquo;s song<br/>
					<br/>
					let&rsquo;s go back to the snails, their infinite spirals<br/>
					O, I will follow their lead inward and outward<br/>
					the dusty rose lips of their bodies latched<br/>
					onto the cadet blue of their spacecraft shells<br/>
					let&rsquo;s look at the thousands of them all at once<br/>
					a spinning French horn section of portholes<br/>
					<br/>
					Summer, I promise:<br/>
					less cell phone email text tumors<br/>
					more red shoes<br/>
					more rescued katydids<br/>
					more donations to drought lands<br/>
					more worry for the warred on<br/>
					more books for the teen library<br/>
					less concern for my sloppy soul<br/>
					less rumors, more cinnamon<br/>
					more radios left on low while drifting on a porch<br/>
					and thrift store LP&rsquo;s spinning jangle guitars<br/>
					more peacock feathered knee socks<br/>
					less sturdy, more tremble<br/>
					<br/>
					Summer<br/>
					of frothing jade mountains<br/>
					blackberry twilight and carnelian kisses<br/>
					Summer of lapis highways and chrome haloed memories<br/>
					of highschool junkers and mystery bells<br/>
					and songs with wide eyes<br/>
					and blonde ponies tramping up the dawn<br/>
					and lit window diary nights writing his name<br/>
					<br/>
					Summer &ndash; kingdom of night blooming jasmine<br/>
					spider web Alhambras<br/>
					electric blue hammock sex boats<br/>
					asphalt melting banjos<br/>
					flash of frog&rsquo;s emerald parenthesis legs<br/>
					Coney Island sparrows and swallows<br/>
					Wonder Wheel fool rolling French kissing<br/>
					butterscotch lighting, O Summer<br/>
					<br/>
					once you found me, I was so overdone<br/>
					I was bit down and wood blooded<br/>
					why must I try so hard?  botched by birth<br/>
					just polish me with Django steel stringed winds<br/>
					<br/>
					Summer you&rsquo;re here<br/>
					Summer, Witch of Sun, Voodoo Moon<br/>
					beat down on my skin<br/>
					make me shine<br/>
